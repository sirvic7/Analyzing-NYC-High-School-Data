# Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data
One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Hence, the aim of this project is to;

Correlate between SAT scores and demographics. The study would seek to find correlation between SAT scores and factors like race, gender etc.
The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's important to perform well.

The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the dataset for this project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.

The focus of this study is narrowed on high schools in New York City
New York City makes its data on high school SAT scores available online, as well as the demographics for each high school. Below are the information to all the datasets used in this project;

1. SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City

2. School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City

3. Class Size - Information on class size for each school

4. AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)

5. Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information

6. Demographics - Demographic information for each school

7. School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school
